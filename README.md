# Internship-Codsoft

During my internship at Codsoft in front-end development, I undertook the creation of three significant projects: a portfolio showcasing my skills and previous work, a dynamic landing page designed to engage users effectively, and a functional calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These projects provided valuable insights into user interface design and front-end development practices. I developed a deep understanding of creating responsive and visually appealing web applications. This internship has equipped me with the practical skills and confidence.
